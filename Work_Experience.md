# CV
Here below is all my relevant experience. 
After graduating from UQAM (UMontreal, Canada) with a bachelors in Economics I decided to try my chances in the country where I was born, Chile. A few months after arriving, I found a great opportunity at Evalueserve. During my 6 months at Evalueserve, I learned about the operational side of Investment banking. I also learned how to automate processes using scripts and create user friendly interfaces. I caried this experience to Jarislowsky Fraser.
