  Welcome to my website! My name is Maricarmen and here I showcase my personal projects as well as the ones I completed during my studies and, when possible, some projects I completed for employers and clients. I have bachelors in Economics from UQAM and a Masters in Business Intelligence from HEC Montreal. My work experience is mostly in operations, automation, research and data management. 
  While the industry I worked mostly for are in the Banking/Finances. I'm open to work in other industries such as Tech, healthcare and crime prevention. 
  In my projects you will be able to see some of the skills necessary to finish the projects 
  For my work experience/CV click on CV-Work Experience. You can download my CV in a pdf format from there or read it directly on my website.
