<img src="/images/me.jpg" width="100">



I have bachelors in Economics from UQAM and a Masters in Business Intelligence from HEC Montreal. I have experience in operations, automation, research, data analysis and data management. Most of my valuable experience has been in the Banking/Finance Industry but I'm also interested in Technology, Healthcare and Crime Prevention. If I had to describe my self I would say that I am curious, tech savvy and result driven. 

In my free time I like to do fitness training, listen to podcasts, draw, learn new skills (usually tech related) and fly my mini drone.
