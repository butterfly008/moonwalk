After graduating from UQAM (UMontreal, Canada) with a bachelors in Economics I decided to try my chances in the country where I was born, Chile. A few months after arriving, I found a great opportunity at Evalueserve. During my 6 months at Evalueserve, I learned about the operational side of Investment banking. I also learned how to automate processes using scripts and create user friendly interfaces. I caried this experience to Jarislowsky Fraser.


I have bachelors in Economics from UQAM and a Masters in Business Intelligence from HEC Montreal. My work experience is mostly in operations, automation, research and data management. 
While the industry I worked mostly for are in the Banking/Finances. I'm open to work in other industries such as Tech, healthcare and crime prevention. 
In my projects you will be able to see some of the skills necessary to finish the projects
