  - title: Detecting Coordinated Activities through OnlyFans\’ Tweets
    url: overview-post
    desc: This Thesis was conducted during my studies at HEC Montreal. In this thesis by articles, 
    we present a research paper that we submitted for theWebSci’23
conference and is now under review. In addition to the article itself, in the thesis, we provide
further detail regarding the motivation, background, literature review and research.
The aim of this thesis is to provide a method that can facilitate the work of individuals
combating online human trafficking. The majority of trafficking victims report being advertised
online, this explains why online sex trafficking has been on the rise in the past few
years. On the other hand, the use of OnlyFans as a platform for adult content has increased
exponentially in the past three years, and Twitter has been its main advertising tool. Since
we know that traffickers usually work within a network and control multiple victims, we
suspect that there may be networks of traffickers promoting multiple OnlyFans accounts
belonging to their victims. Based on these observations, we decided to conduct the first
study looking at organized activities on Twitter through OnlyFans advertisements. Preliminary
analysis of this space shows that most tweets related to OnlyFans contains generic
text, making text-based methods less reliable. Instead, focusing on what ties the authors
of these tweets together, we propose a novel method for uncovering coordinated networks
of users based on their behaviour. Our method, called Multi-Level Clustering (MLC),
combines two levels of clustering. In the first level, we detect communities based on username Mentions and shared URLs, while the second level is done through two different
approaches i) the Partial Intersections (PI) of URLs and Mention communities ii)
Joint Clustering (JT) by applying a subraph dense detection algorithm. We additionally
successfully proved that our JT approach applied on synthetically generated data (with
injected ground truth) shows a superior performance compared to competitive baselines.
Furthermore, we apply the MLC to real-world data of tweets pertaining to OnlyFans and
analyse the detected groups and show that our Partial Intersections provides good quality
clusters (high entropy of OnlyFans accounts). Our paper and our thesis end with a
discussion where we show carefully chosen examples of organized clusters and provide
multiple interesting points that supports our method.
